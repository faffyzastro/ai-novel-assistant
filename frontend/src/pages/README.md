# pages/

This folder contains route-level page components for the app (e.g., Login, Dashboard, StoryEditor).

- Each file here represents a top-level route in the app.
- Pages are kept modular and focused on layout and page-level logic.
- Use the `components/` folder for reusable UI elements.

// This structure helps keep the app scalable and maintainable.
